"use strict"  // treat all js code as newer version es6
console.log("hello vikas lets do this u ready")

// alert("hey bot")  
// alert will output a dialog box or alret box in our browser on the top of the document ... 

// ehh nibba no popup arrived
// its not js browser engine its not we cant do this here u can do this in brower console ok...

// spacing

// we avoid semicolons while in react 
// try to make your code readable

// console.log("vikas"),console.log("hey") // its a bad practice noreadibily accepted 

console.log("vikas");
console.log("hey");

// this is the good habbit

// now lets dicsuss about datatypes in js

// what are datatypes ?
 
// se when ever we want to do some operations on our variables like console.log(10+vikas) computer did.nt understand how to solve this as computer will take 10+vikas = 10vikas so to solve this we have to give a datatype according to the value a variable holds

console.log(10+"vikas"); 
 // we will see we have aoutput saying 10vikas but is it ok to add a number with some characters no it is not..... also what the hell is number and this characters means ...?

 // in js simply we have 8 type of datatypes means we can store 8 types of data in js.... 



 //number
 //string
 //boolean
 //undefined
 //null
 //object
 //symbols
 //big int



 //confused...?
 
 //let me state more supose we have a empty vessel and we can store anytype of thing in it right.... ummm lets say my fav is balabjamun i will fill my empty vessel with balamjalam..... but my mind changes after sometime and i drop that balamjalam and fill my empty vessel with a metal gold... woww....

 // means we have a container or vessel whihc is called as a varibale in js and we can store anytype of value insdie them like charatcters or nu,bers or etc..

 // lets find how many dataypes we have 

 // we have total 8 data types

 let age = 18;   // here the name of the empty vessel is age and we store a number value in it .. and it should be a number as our logic says... 

 //what youo want to store a name here .... o gosh come on ok lets do this..

 age = "potato"  // yes it will run fine but your age is pottao as it doesnt make snese..... 

 let name = "vikas";  // here we name that empty vessel name and value this container storing is a combination of characters vikas.... \
 // remember we add a double quote and then inside vikas.... these double quotes tells computer that name vessel has a value called STRING 

 //what is string....?

 // simply a string is a datatype in which we store a combination of character or even a single character it twlls computer that these are not maths number 

 // if we take "2" +"2"  // this will output 22 as inside a double quote it is treated a s astring datatype and maths oprations are perfomed like a fool...

 // but why 22 why not 4 ..?
 // see when we want to add m=number for god sake letts say...what we do vikas +boy=vikasboy.. we take characters and ad them means combined them in next to eaach other no maths operations....
 // and whn we do 2+2 we get 4 as we know in maths 2+2 is 4 but if "3+3"
//  it will output 3+3 as now thesee numbers are trated a s a character abd character always adds next to them not add but combined even it willnot tolarte if + is added it takes + as  a character too "3"+"3"  33

let userActive=true;

// what is this true....?
// dont worry its just a data type means it only has two values true or false means ya to hai ya nhi hai...

// true hold 1 false hold 0 

// eh nigga stop what u mean 1  and 0...
// means true has value 1 and false says 0 

console.log(true+true);
// it will return us 2 as 1+1 is 2 

let distanceFromSunToBlackolen = BigInt("12345678987654323456789876543211234567898765432");
 console.log(distanceFromSunToBlackolen);

 // bigint is used to store a big number as the name specifys big integer..

 // the  term bigint tells that the vessel or varibale is a bigint 

 let big=BigInt("2326376473674637"); // inside double quotes only numbers allowed not chararcyters..

 console.log(big); 

 let dog; // it is a undefined datatype as the vessel named dog has no value but it can add some value so it is undefined yet...

 let cat=null;  // now by writing null we state that veese or variable cat has no value and it will neither holds a value... alos type of null is a object

 let kite = Symbol("yellow");

 let kite2=Symbol("yellow");

 console.log(kite)
 console.log(kite2);


 // a symbol is a datatype which help us to make our variable unique although they can have a same value... 

 let car={
    name:"alto",
    price:200000
 };

 // a object is  adataype where we can store our data with key value pairs or with properties and values like car datatype may have properties like name or price etc ..

 console.log(car.price);
 // here we say that from car we need value of price property

 // so thats about datatypes... bye seee u sooon
