// lets leran comparison opwrtaorss 
// comaprison oprators alwatys returns us true or false
// how many typs of comparison operators are 
 let a = 10; // this is  anumbr 

 let b = "10"; // this is a string but valuaes are same

 console.log(a==b);  // it will retur true as the vaue of both a and b is sam as 10 

 console.log(a===b);  // RETURN FALSE
  // hre we state that value and datattype of a is eqa;l to b whih is not true as b is holding the samee value thoughbhut the datattype of b is a string

  console.log(true==1); // will return true as ture holds 1 value and `1 is one so both arfe eqaul

  console.log(true===1); // false as true is holding the samew value though but the datatype  of true is a boolean and datattypoe of 1 is a number 

  // > < is greater then and is less then tehse are alo vomparison operators 

  let  c = 10;
  let d = 11;

  console.log(d>c);  // retuns true as d is grerater then c 

  console.log(d<c); // returns false as d is not sa=maller and we satte thgat d is damlller then c 

  // !=   is not equals !== is not eqal and dattaype too

  let e = 10;
  let f = 11;

  console.log(e!=f); // retur true as e is not eqaul to f 

console.log(true !=1); // reyurns false as true is eqL TO 1 

console.log(true!== 1); // returns true as ture and 1 is not eqal in dattype



// thanks thats all abt comparison operators :)
